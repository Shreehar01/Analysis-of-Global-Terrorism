## Project Information
Terrorism has been a constant hindrance on our effort to achieve global peace and prosperity. From hostage situations and hijackings to mass shootings and bombings, terrorist attacks have a profound impact on both the victims and the larger society; they cause physical harm and loss of life, as well as emotional trauma and psychological distress. Needless to say, they can have long-lasting socioeconomic consequences, disrupting trade and commerce, causing job losses, and decreasing investor confidence.

As the frequency of terrorist attacks is increasing at a rate faster than ever, it is crucial to understand them and their trends and patterns. In this blog post, I will be examining various aspects of terrorism including regions, targets, methods, and motives using three open-source datasets.

The first dataset, [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd), contains information on over 180,000 global terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017. Similarly, the two other datasets - [World, Region, Country GDP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmishinev/world-country-gdp-19602021) and [World Bank National Accounts data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), includes the data for Gross Domestic Production (GDP), fertility rate and net migration of different countries in the aforementioned period. All the three datasets were retrieved from the popular data science website [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

I hope this project will shed some light on the phenomenon of global terrorism and will equip us better to combat them in the future. So let's roll up our sleeves and demystify the world of global terrorism.
