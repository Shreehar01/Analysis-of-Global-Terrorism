# Introduction

Global terrorism has been a major concern for countries across the world for many decades. Terrorist attacks are defined as acts of violence committed by individuals or groups with the intention of causing harm and destruction to a large number of people. These attacks can take many forms, including bombings, mass shootings, hijackings, and hostage situations, and can occur in any location, from urban centers to remote rural areas.

Terrorist attacks have a profound impact on both the victims and the larger society. They cause physical harm and loss of life, as well as emotional trauma and psychological distress. They can also have long-lasting socio-economic consequences, disrupting trade and commerce, causing job losses, and decreasing investor confidence.

In recent years, some of the most devastating terrorist attacks have occurred in cities across the globe, such as Paris, Madrid, London, and New York. These attacks have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and have had a profound impact on the global community. In response to these attacks, many countries have increased their efforts to prevent and counteract terrorism, including by strengthening their security measures, enhancing their intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities, and working together with international partners to share information and coordinate efforts.

Despite these efforts, the threat of terrorism continues to persist, with new groups emerging and existing ones adapting their tactics. As the world becomes more interconnected, the risk of terrorism spreading across borders increases, making it all the more important for countries to work together to address this global challenge.

# Datasets

In this project, three different datasets will be used to analyse the trends of terrorist activities and their impact on social and economic health of different countries that are plagued the most by such activities.

The first dataset - [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd) - is an open-source database including information on more than 180,000 terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism ([START](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)), headquartered at the University of Maryland. Prepared by reviewing more than 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources, it is the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world. The variables that will be use in the analysis from this dataset are as follows:

* eventid: The 12-digit event id of the incident.
* iyear: The year in which the incident occured
* imonth: The month in which the incident occured
* iday: The day in which the incident occured
* country: The country code in which the incident occured
* country_txt: The country name in which the incident occured
* region_txt: The geographic region in which the incident occured
* prov_state: The name of the 1st order subnational administrative region
* city: The city in which the incident occured
* latitude: The latitude of the city in which the incident occured
* longitude: The longitude of the city in which the incident occured
* suicide: A flag indicating if the incident was a suicide attack
* attacktype1_txt: The general method of attack and broad class of tactic used
* targtype1_txt: The general type of the target/victim
* gname: The name of the group that carried out the attack
* motive: The motive of the terrorist attacks
* weaptype1_txt: The general type of the weapon used in the incident
* nkill: The total number of confirmed fatalties for the incident

The second dataset - [World, Region, Country GDP/GDP per capita](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmishinev/world-country-gdp-19602021) - is an open-source dataset in kaggle consisting of the Gross Domestic Product of different dfferent countries of the world from 1960 to 2021. It was created by Todor Mishinev using the [World Bank national accounts data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD). The variables that will be used from this dataset are as follows:

* Country Name: The name of the country
* Country Code: The three letter codes for the countries
* year: The year for which the GDP data is recorded
* GDP_per_capita: GDP per capita for a specific country in the given year 

Similarly, the third dataset - [World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nguyenthicamlai/population-2022) - is an open-source dataset in kaggle consisting of different information of the world population from 1955 to 2020. It was created by Nguen Thi Cam Lai using the [Countries in the world by population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) dataset from the Worldometer. The variables that will be used from this dataset are as follows:

* Year: The year for which the population data is recorded
* Migrants(net): The net number of migrants in a country
* FertlityRate: The fertility rate of a specific country

# Data Acquisition and Processing

[In this section, if applicable, describe how you will obtain the data (if it's
anything more complicated than a simple download). Discuss what data 
processing steps will be needed, such as recoding variables, data cleaning,
data tidying, imputing missing values, etc. See sections 1c, 1d, 1e in the 
"Good Enough Practices" paper.]

# Research Questions and Methodology

The following questions will be answered in this project:

### Focus on US

1. Which states in US had the highest number of terrorist attacks? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on the provstate and event id respectively - that lists the number of terrorist attacks in each state, filter the dataframe to include data for US and then plot a mapplot that shows the frequency of occurence of attacks in each state. The gradient of the color for each state will be proportional to the number of attacks.

2. How has the motive of terrorist attack shifted over the last five years in the US? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe that consists of rows representing terrorist incidents in US and then use the motive variable to plot the Word Cloud. The plot will have the most repeated words for the motive and the size of the words will represent the frequency of their occurence.

### Focus on the world

3. How has the frequency of terrorist attacks changed over the last five decades? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on the year and event id respectively - that lists the number of terrorist attacks in each year and then plot an interactive lineplot that shows the trend of the occurence.  

4. Which geographical region has had the highest number of terrorist attacks? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on region and event id respectively - that lists the count of attacks for each of the geographical region and then plot a mosaic plot displaying the data. The plot will be filled with distinct colors for each of the region and the size of the boxes representing each region will be proportional to their number of attacks.

5. How does the frequency of attack types vary across geographical regions? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on region and attack type and event id respectively - that lists the count of different types of attacks for each of the geographical region and then plot a stacked bar plot displaying the data. All the bars will have the same height and width and each of them will represent a distinct geographical region. The bars will be filled with sub-bar plots of different colors, each of which will represent the type of attack for the given region. The height of each of the sub-bar plots will be proportional to the frequency of the attack type.

6. Which countries had the highest number of terrorist attacks? To answer this question, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on country and event id respectively - that lists the count of attacks for each of the countries and then plot a bar plot displaying the data. The plot will be filled with distinct colors for each of the top 10 countries in descending order of the counts of attacks.

7. Do the countries with the highest number of terrorist attacks also have the highest number of people who were killed? To answer this question, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on country and event id respectively - that lists the number of people who were killed from each of the countries and then plot a bar plot displaying the data. The plot will be filled with distinct colors for each of the top 10 countries in descending order of the number of people who where killed.

8. What are the most common attack methods used by terrorist groups? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and count function based on type of attack and event id respectively - that lists the count of different types of attack methods used by the terrorist group and then plot a bar chart displaying the data. The bar chart will be filled with distinct colors for each of the attack methods and sorted in descending order from the left to right.

9. Which terrorist groups is the most deadliest (in terms of the number of people killed)? To answer this, I will first create a dataframe - using the groupby and sum function based on group name and number of people killed respectively - that lists the number of people killed by each terrorist groups and then plot a mosaic plot displaying the data. The plot will be filled with same color but of different sizes for each terrorist groups, where the size of the boxes will be proportional to the number of people they have killed.

### Focus on socio-economic factors

10. Is there any correlation between the GDP per capita and number of terrorist attacks in a country? To answer this question, I will create a dataframe (referred to as dfCount henceforth) by selecting five countries with the highest number of terrorist attacks and calculate the number of terrorist attacks for each year for these countries by using the groupby and count function in country and year and event id respectively. I will then join this dataframe with our second dataset based on year and country column. The resulting data will be used in a lineplot where the line will represent number of terrorist attacks for each year in a country. On the same lineplot, another line indicating the GDP capita of the country for each year will be plotted. The two lines will be of different color, which will be explained on a legend. To make sure that the lines are not of irregular scale (which is highly likely as GDP and the number of terrorist attacks differ largely in their magnitudes), both of them will be standardized to represent the minimum value of each category as 0 and the maximum value as 1. Lastly, each of the countries will have their own lineplot and altogether, there will be 5 lineplots in a facte grid. The trends on these five terrorist-prone countries will give us a general indication of existence of relationship between GDP per capita and the number of terrorist attacks.

11. Is there any correlation between the net number of migrants and the number of terrorist attacks in a country? To answer this question, I join the dfCount dataframe from 10 with our third dataset based on year and country column. The resulting data (referred to as dfJoinedThird henceforth) will be used in a lineplot where the line will represent number of terrorist attacks for each year in a country. On the same lineplot, another line indicating the net number of migrants of the country for each year will be plotted. The two lines will be of different color, which will be represented accordingly on a legend. To make sure that the lines are not of irregular scale (which is highly likely as net number of migrants and the number of terrorist attacks differ largely in their magnitudes), both of them will be standardized to represent the minimum value of each category as 0 and the maximum value as 1. Lastly, each of the countries will have their own lineplot and altogether, there will be 5 lineplots on a facet grid. The trends on these five terrorist-prone countries will give us a general indication of existence of relationship between net number of migrants and the number of terrorist attacks.

12. Is there any correlation between the fertility rate and the number of terrorist attacks in a country? To answer this question, I will use the dataframe dfJoinedThird from 11 to plot in a lineplot where the line will represent number of terrorist attacks for each year in a country. On the same lineplot, another line indicating the fertility rate of the country for each year will be plotted. The two lines will be of different color, which will be represented accordingly on a legend. To make sure that the lines are not of irregular scale (which is highly likely as fertility rate and the number of terrorist attacks differ largely in their magnitudes), both of them will be standardized to represent the minimum value of each category as 0 and the maximum value as 1. Lastly, each of the countries will have their own lineplot and altogether, there will be 5 lineplots on a facet grid. The trends on these five terrorist-prone countries will give us a general indication of existence of relationship between the fertility rate and the number of terrorist attacks.

### Modeling

13. Can we predict the number of casulaties from the features in the database? To answer this question, the variables of the first dataset listed in dataset section will be first checked for their "importance" using the feature importance feature of random forest classifier. The top 10 variables in terms of importance will then be selected and label encoded if they are categorical in nature, and ultimately used to perform a train-test split in the ratio 80:20. The train dataset will be used to train five different machine learning models (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XG Boost, and Ada Boost Classifier). The models will be tested on the test set with mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination as their evaluation metrices. The result will be assessed to reach to decision of whether the existing variables are sufficient or not to predict the number of casulaties of terrorist attacks.
